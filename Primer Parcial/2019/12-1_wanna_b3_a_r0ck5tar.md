```bash
Rocknroll is right
Silence is wrong
A guitar is a six-string        
Tommy's been down
Music is a billboard-burning razzmatazz!
Listen to the music             
If the music is a guitar
Say "Keep on rocking!"
Listen to the rhythm
If the rhythm without Music is nothing
Tommy is rockin guitar
Shout Tommy!
Music is amazing sensation 
Jamming is awesome presence
Scream Music!
Scream Jamming!
Tommy is playing rock           
Scream Tommy!       
They are dazzled audiences
Shout it!
Rock is electric heaven
Scream it!
Tommy is jukebox god            
Say it!
Break it down
Shout "Bring on the rock!"
```
